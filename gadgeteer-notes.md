Ghul on the hypborea forums bringing up the weird science/science fantasy aspects of Hyperborea

That got me thinking about a class that fits into that.

The idea of a class that focuses on understanding, using, and bodging lost tech.

My initial class name was tinkerer

Rhialto brought up Warriors of the Red Planet and its Scientist class.

I was thinking of what class abilities to give it

* magician's alchemy
* detect secret doors as thief types
* thief's manipulate traps
* thief's open locks
* create incendiary oil
* make mechanical/metal based automatons

Rhialto then wrote up the meat of the class description

Rhialto noticed some redundancies I need to remove.

The file still has gadgeteer vs weird scientist for the name.
