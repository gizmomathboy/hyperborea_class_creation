Ghul on the hypborea forums bringing up the weird science/science fantasy aspects of Hyperborea

That got me thinking about a class that fits into that.

The idea of a class that focuses on understanding, using, and bodging lost tech.

My initial class name was tinkerer

Rhialto brought up Warriors of the Red Planet and its Scientist class.

I was thinking of what class abilities to give it

* magician's alchemy
* detect secret doors as thief types
* thief's manipulate traps
* thief's open locks
* create incendiary oil
* make mechanical/metal based automatons

Rhialto then wrote up the meat of the class description

Rhialto noticed some redundancies I need to remove.

The file still has gadgeteer vs weird scientist for the name.

Rhialto brought up a good point/idea: reusing existing mechanics. I posited using turn table/combat table.
I mentioned using the bonus spells as a bonus to rolls. Now I think the language bonus is better and "easier".
  
I was looking at the thief progressive abilities table for mechanics to reuse there. Nothing seemed to resonate
with me. Maybe use the Read Scroll for *Read Weird Science*, but as a thief 4 levels higher? So a 1st level gadgeteer has a 0:12 chance to read weird science writings and such.

With some thought, the saving throw idea isn't half bad a mechanic either.

I think the bonus languages modifier is useful in both contexts.

There are 2 other things rattling in my head still:

a) gadgets acquired by level

Kind of like the runes of a runegraver. So, I just need to think up 16 gadgets that are appropriate and not to overpowered.

b) learn "tech" language

Every 3 or 4 levels learn an language that will help with old secrets and technology: Hyperborean, Atlantean, and Amazonian come to mind. Other races that might be possible: aboleths, crab-men, elder things, fish-men, the Great Race, mi-go, night-gaunts, phoongh, snake-men, spore-men, and tentacular horrors.

Maybe put a mechanic on it sort of like mastery. Base 3:12 to able to decipher a language. At each progression can choose a new language at a base 3:12 or increase the base by 1.

Adding these might necessitate a bump in the XP progression tables.
