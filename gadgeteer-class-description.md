**Gadgeteer/Weird Scientist**

Weird Scientists are masters of forgotten Amazonian, Atlantean and Hyperborean lore, lost technologies, and new weird inventions of their own devising. While most folks fear such things, Weird Scientists are fascinated by such lost lore. Weird Scientists may use any weapons, but typically favor lost artifacts or their own creations. The tinkerer is at heart a scavenger of parts.

**Class Abilities:**

*Folklore* like the bard but restricted to artefacts and old tech, for lack of a better description


*Read Languages:* can learn/decipher ancient languages, assuming there is a manual about to read

*alchemy* Per magician classes

*create incendiary oil* Gadgeteers of GA 1-3 can create 1 flask of Greek Fire per week; those of GA 4-6: 2 flasks per week; those of GA 7-9: 3 per flasks week; and those of GA 10-12: 4 flasks per week. This is dependent upon access to proper materials. Each flask costs 30 gp to make.

*Make Bronze or Iron Automatons:* Gadgeteers can make Bronze or Iron Automatons with the appropriate Manual of Automaton Creation.

*Clandestine Tongue (Weird Science):* The obscure language of pseudo-scientists, a strange tongue in which some words may be unintelligible to an ignorant listener, whereas others might be common yet of alternative meaning. This scientifically opaque tongue is used in conjunction with arcane mathematical formulae. Some call this the tongue of the Anunnaki, a mysterious race predating all known humans of Hyperborea.

*Weird Science Item Use:* Can utilize magic items normally restricted to Magicians, but only if of a weird science origin. Also some like laser swords, radium pistols, amazon skyships, and other things that are more tech than "magic" in nature.

*Weird Science Item Repair:* They can potentially repair, recharge, or otherwise get an item working that normally others can't. That scope on the laser rifle that just jammed? Maybe a chance to fix it, or that same rifle ran out of charges they can get an additional charge or two. A successful SV is needed. A bonus equal the language bonus is applied along with any penalties the Referee may deem appropriate for complexity or difficulty.

*Read Weird Science:* The ability to decipher unintelligible weird science inscriptions or symbols placed on weapons, armor, items, doors, walls, scrolls and other media.

*Artefact Identification:* Ability to figure out artefacts. A successful roll for each stage is required to progress to the next stage. Stage one might be skipped if there is a "normal" analogue, e.g. radium pistol vs crossbow, laser spear vs spear, etc.

Regardless of success, 1d4 Constitution is used and regained at 1 point per hour or rest. If Constitution drops to 3 or less than the Gadgeteer is knocked unconscious for 24 hours.

  1. do you have any idea this is?
  2. can you power it up?
  3. can you activate it?
  4. can you use effectively?

There are two proposed resolution mechanics to succeed at each stage.

1. Make a successful SV with a bonus equal the language bonus is applied along with any penalties the Referee may deem appropriate for complexity or difficulty.

2. Using the Combat Matrix rolling for a successful hit using the AC as an approximation of the complexity or difficulty with a bonus equal the language bonus is applied along with any penalties the Referee may deem appropriate for complexity or difficulty.


*Laboratory:* At 9th level, a weird scientist who establishes a suitable laboratory will attract a band of followers: 1d12+12 weird science devotees of 0th level (1d4 hp, each with a smattering of nascent weird science abilities) who will serve without pay in exchange for tutelage under their master. The laboratory might be in a city, town, or village. If said laboratory is part of his castle or fortified manor, with a 5- to 10-mile radius of control, the weird scientist also becomes eligible to attract a small body of men-at-arms, 0th-level fighters of 1d8 hp each.Here follows a typical troop:


    -  **10 shortbowmen** (studded armour, short bows, short swords)
    -  **10 light crossbowmen** (chain mail, small shields, light crossbows, long spears, short swords)
    -  **10 halberdiers / pikemen** (splint armour, halberds or pikes, hand axes)


Attracted units include one officer, a 2nd-level fighter responsible for the unit and for communication betwixt the weird scientist and his men. If the reputation of the weird scientist is favourable, further troops may be attracted. Men-at-arms receive 10 gp per month for their service, plus 50 gp for the officer. Common inhabitants of the weird scientistâ€™s domain will provide 5 sp in taxes per person per month. Once control and reputation have been established, the weird scientist also will attract 1d2 apprentice weird scientists (0th-level), who will petition him for learning.
